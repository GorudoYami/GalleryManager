TODO:
	->	Add media info in browser
	->	Fix importer counting (when you remove directory/drive it doesn't subtract files)
	->	Bugfixes
	->	Default location cannot be simply Z:\ - rather let it be empty, and if empty don't load Media
	->	On startup make an async so the ui shows rather than waits for connection
